# PokeDex Discord bot

Welcome to my first side project. I have written a simple discord bot that will display info about pokemon via a free API I found called PokeAPI. In this program I have created a small list of commands that allow a user to get info about a pokemon quickly.

## New Learnings

Here is where I will document all of the new things I have learned whilst writing this bot.

1. The first thing that I learned about was asynchronous functions and how they work. This was interesting to learn about and im sure it will prove useful in the future.
2. I also learned about Decorators and their syntax. Decorators are a way to alter the behavior of a function that already exists without altering its source code with the @ symbol being used to call a wrapper function
3. Working with APIs. I learned to use the requests library as well as the JSON library to query an api and get the results to a dictionary in python so that the data can be accessed. In this bot I used discord.py which is a wrapper for the discord api and queried the pokeapi via the requests standard library.
4. Debugging. When writing code debugging is often the most tedious and anger inducing part. In writing this bot I learned and implemented new techniques for debugging code that helped in speeding up my productivity.
5. Markdown. I had to learn markdown syntax to write up this document and will prove useful in writing future readmes.
